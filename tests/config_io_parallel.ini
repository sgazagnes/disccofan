# Area/DAP/Pattern spectrum configuration file
# Version: 1.5
# Purpose: This program filters 1D, 2D, or 3D images using distributed-memory parallel computation of max-trees
# Description: Area: Input files are expected to be preprocessed into tiles of the form [inprefix]-[x].[intype], e.g., tile-1.pgm to tile-8.pgm for a 2x2x2 grid. HDF5 files can be used (name should be [inprefix].h5).
# Fits images can be used (name should be [inprefix].fits). Output files will be generated following the same grid with [outprefix]-[x].[outtype], e.g., out-1.pgm to out-8.pgm for typical images format,
# HDF5 files will be saved as [outprefix].h5 and fits images as [outprefix].fits.
# CSL: Three external output will be produced, the contrast output (C), the luminance (L), and the scale (S).
# Pattern: Only one output is produced, the pattern.txt file.

# Filename handling
# These options select the prefix of the in- and output tiles, as well as the filetype and dataset name for HDF5 files
