All techniques that **disccofan** is using were published in three different papers:

- `Concurrent Computation of Attribute Filters on Shared Memory Parallel Machines <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4407727>`_ 
- `Distributed Component Forests in 2-D: Hierarchical Image Representations Suitable for Tera-Scale Images <https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S0218001419400123?srsltid=AfmBOorzh_s6u-6cin0VpWfJYVFr3kvkKw8Chr1SxBPhBGWghmRcXMPG>`_ 
- `Distributed Connected Component Filtering and Analysis in 2D and 3D Tera-Scale Data Sets <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9376636>`_
